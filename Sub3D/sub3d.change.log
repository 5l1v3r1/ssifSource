Version 1.009 - 05/28/16 - alpha
	* added "progress" boolean parameter to CalcSRTDepths function to show processing progress in console

Version 1.008 - 01/29/16 - alpha
	* added donation info page

Version 1.007 - 01/09/16 - alpha
	* SetConfThreshold function removed (was buggy in case of mean_depth&mean_conf measuments).
	  Added CalcForFrameRaw(threshold) function instead. See sub3d.lua for reference. threshold = 0.0 if not specified.
	  CalcForFrameRaw() returns nil in case of no values 
	* Confidence value measurement scaled a little bit. 0.0 confidence -> 0.5. More gradations added.
	* New Lua function added - GetFrameRawData() - returning raw depths information.
	  See debug printings that was added to sub3d.lua for reference.
	* Changed CalcForFrame return value interpretation (now no return value) and deleted last parameter from CalcForSub
	  function. 'depth' values retriving still possible via global variable.

Version 1.006 - 01/04/16 - alpha
	* tools3d.avsi added with useful format conversion functions
	* mean_depth in lua now number value (not integer)
	* added SetConfThreshold lua function (for usage see sub3d.lua)
	* confidence now is value between 0 and 1.

Version 1.005 - 12/22/15 - alpha
	* documentation in sub3d.avs cleanup (thanks to r0lZ)
	* added new global variables to Lua (see sub3d.lua)
	* added ability to write .ofs format (see sub3d.lua)
	* SetLogger now restores original handles if called with default parameters

Version 1.004 - 12/21/15 - alpha
	* fixed a bug when SetDepthComputationAlg function did not work
	* fixed a bug when depths in xml were divided by 2
	* fixed a bug in sub3d-old.lua when it did not work
	* filmtester.exe tool added to render your avs files
	* example code to use .avs for depth calculations only added into sub3d.avs

Version 1.003 - 12/20/15 - alpha
	* "Restore Alpha" algorithm implemented. Now you can use this technique with any subtitle rendering engine (see sub3d-3.avs example).
	* 'masksub' optional parameter added for CalcSRTDepths & RenderSRT functions (see sub3d-3.avs where it's used).
	* Both vsfilter dlls added to the package:
		* VSFilter.klite.dll aka xy-vsfilter. Renders srt/ass subs. Has issues with accent symbols
		* VSFilter.mpc.dll aka DirectVobSub (MPC filter). Rejects to render .srt files. Renders .ass even with accent symbols
	* Depth rounding unification (see sub3d.lua: (depth + 1) / 2) among all algorithms.
	* OpenMP optimization tuning.

Version 1.002 - 12/19/15 - prerelease
	* fixed 3d planes generation algorithm to generate planes according standart (see sub3d.lua)
	* confidence values added to CalcForFrame
	* .depths format changed! It is not compatible with previous one. Moreover, additional info added at the end of file
	* sub3d-old.lua added with old subtitle depth calculation formula
	* minor speed-ups

Version 1.001 - 12/19/15 - prerelease
	* fixed lengthinframes value in CalcForSub lua function (it was lastframe instead lengthinframes)
	* added FRAME_COUNT global lua value
	* added OnFinish function support (presence of this function is not necessary). It is called after all calculations performed.
	* example writing 3D planes bin file (see sub3d.lua)
